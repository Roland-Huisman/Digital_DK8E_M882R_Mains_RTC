# Digital_DK8E_M882R_Mains_RTC

This is a 74xx clone of the Digital DK8E M882R Mains Real Time Clock for the DEC PDP8/E family computers. It's called the DK8E M882R.

There are no DEC or SP chips used. Only 74xx and 74HCTxx series chips are used. It passes the maindec-08-dhdka-a test.

I hope to do some more redesigns of several Omnibus boards. Prices are getting insane and in this way you can build as many boards as you want to have. If you want to built these boards and sell them on Ebay, you are more then welcome to do that. In this way you can help other people to get these boards which probably are not able to solder them by them self.

All documents are profided as-is. I have to check which lisence is the best suitable for the project.

Regards, Roland
